## Security Best Practices
When using codec2, the following security measures are recommended:
1. **Permission Control**: Restrict access to `/dev/mpp_service` device nodes with appropriate permissions
2. **Timely Updates**: Keep codec2 and the drm kernel driver updated to the latest version to receive the latest security fixes
3. **Memory Safety**: When using virtual addresses, ensure proper memory mapping and avoid accessing unmapped or protected memory regions
